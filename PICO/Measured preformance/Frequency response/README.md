The frequency response tests show the relation between frequency and the output magnetic flux strength. The test were all done with the setup seen in the [setup images](https://github.com/AxelFougues/Lodestone-biomagnet-tools/tree/main/PICO/Measured%20preformance/Frequency%20response/Setup).

They were done for each of the main wave types (Sine, Square, Saw) and with two different apps (ZINC and the free Frequency Generator by LuxDeLux) with all volume settings maxed.

We can see that the output strenght does depend on the app as ZINC has significantly higher outputs. 

That said the frequency response seems pretty much identical except from the ZINC-Saw. 
It was carried out twice to exclude the possibility of user error. This phenomenon will be investigated.
