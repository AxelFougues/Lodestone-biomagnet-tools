# 🔍Background
Biomagnets are tiny magnetic implants that lay right under the skin. They can be stimulated by external magnetic fields. For now they are used to detect existing sources like high electric current, permanent magnets and electronic circuits. But what if we produced the field on purpose and used this sixth sense more?

Lodestones do exactly that! They are designed with practicality, accessibility and expandability in mind. The goal is to promote and discover new and exciting uses for biomagnets by making the tools as simple and accessible as possible.

# 💚Purchase and support
 [Get your Lodestone now on my Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/AxelFougues). Be aware these are home made with the support of the community so there might be delays in availability. But I'll make sure you get one!

# 🧲Lodestone PICO
 The PICO has the form factor of a USB-C stick. It is plug n' play on mobile and PC. It's not very powerful but makes up for it by being completely passive (no need to charge) and very practical for every day use! Simple is better!

 The Lodestones were designed to be used in tandem with my upcoming cyborg-multitool app. It will provide advanced and experimental features to accompany the loadstones such as games, automated tests and more: [Android NFC cyborg multitool development](https://forum.dangerousthings.com/t/android-nfc-cyborg-multitool-development/17772)
